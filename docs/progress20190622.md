VanillaVB is design for provides an compiler platform and javascript runtime environment for writing a data computing program in webbrowser or nodejs environment.

Here is the current work progress of vanilla compiler:

#### 1. Enable you compile a VisualBasic project 

You can write you application code and config the assembly information, assembly compile output location, etc in VisualStudio

Currently A VisualBasic.NET webassembly project is mainly consist of multiple Module source files, as the WebAssembly is mainly design for numeric computing, so you VB

Currently the CPU platform config is not yet supported. And ``X86`` will map to ``Wasm32`` and ``X64`` will map to ``Wasm64`` in the feature development works.

#### 2. ``Array`` and ``List(Of T)`` supported 

Array is a kind of fixed length memory block in WebAssembly runtime memory and List(Of T) is a kind of array object in javascript runtime

#### 3. Flow control structure supported

Supportes: For Loop, While Loop, Until Loop, If Else. 
> Note: currently ``For Each`` loop is not yet supported.

#### 4. ``Class`` and ``Structure`` supported 

``Class`` and ``Structure`` is designed for different purpose. ``Class`` is mainly design for data computing in WebAssembly runtime, and ``Structure`` is mainly design for exchange data between WebAssembly runtime and javascript runtime.

> Currently ``Class`` and ``Structure`` only supports fields. The member property, instance member method/function and constructor function is not yet supported.

One man's power is small and limited.
