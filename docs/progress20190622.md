# WebAssembly Compiler Development Progress #2019-06-22#

For make sure the compiler

The source code of the compiler have been move to a new repository: [dotvanilla/vanilla](https://github.com/dotvanilla/vanilla).

VanillaVB is a compiler project that target WebAssembly platform. And it is build upon the [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) compiler services, so you can write your WebAssembly application in VisualStudio use VisualBasic.NET language and then compile to WebAssembly by use ``Vanilla``.


VanillaVB is design for provides an compiler platform and javascript runtime environment for writing a data computing program in webbrowser or nodejs environment.

Here is the current work progress of vanilla compiler:

#### 1. Enable you compile a VisualBasic project 

You can write you application code and config the assembly information, assembly compile output location, etc in VisualStudio

A VisualBasic.NET webassembly project is mainly consist of multiple Module source files, as the WebAssembly is mainly design for numeric computing, so you VB

Currently the CPU platform config is not yet supported. And ``X86`` will map to ``Wasm32`` and ``X64`` will map to ``Wasm64`` in the feature development works.

Here is a quick guidance about compile your VB project by ``vanilla``:

#### 2. ``Array`` and ``List(Of T)`` supported 

Array is a kind of fixed length memory block in WebAssembly runtime memory and List(Of T) is a kind of array object in javascript runtime

#### 3. Flow control structure supported

Supportes: For Loop, While Loop, Until Loop, If Else. 
> Note: currently ``For Each`` loop is not yet supported.

#### 4. ``Class`` and ``Structure`` supported 

``Class`` and ``Structure`` is designed for different purpose. ``Class`` is mainly design for data computing in WebAssembly runtime, and ``Structure`` is mainly design for exchange data between WebAssembly runtime and javascript runtime.

> Currently ``Class`` and ``Structure`` only supports fields. The member property, instance member method/function and constructor function is not yet supported.

#### 5. Enum, String, primitive data types

Currently vanilla compiler supports the 4 primitive numeric data type in webAssembly, and the ``Enum`` is a kind of alias name of Integer/Long is also well supported. ``String`` and ``Char`` is also supported, but they are the same, as ``Char`` and ``String`` is the same in javascript runtime.

> In .NET Framework, the ``String`` is a kind of Object, it has some instance member property and method functions. These instance member property and methods is not yet supported in vanilla compiler, so which it means the ``String`` just a kind of data, not an object like it in .NET environment currently.


One man's power is small and limited. As I struggling at other research area, So I'm not able to keeps a very frequency update on vanilla compiler project. If you want to make contribution on this WebAssembly compiler for VisualBasic.NET language, please let me know. I can invite you to join the [dotvanilla](https://github.com/dotvanilla) as a collaborator.
